def filter_by_overall_copies(df, copies, field='clone_id'):
    '''
    Removes clones identified by ``field`` (default ``clone_id``) from a
    DataFrame with *less than* ``copies`` total copies across all pools.

    Changing ``field`` changes the definition of a clone.  For example, setting
    ``field`` to ``'cdr3_aa'`` will defined clones by their CDR3 AA sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        The DataFrame to filter.
    copies : int
        The minimum copy number of each clone required to be included in the
        resulting DataFrame.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame filtered by copies.

    Examples
    --------
    The following removes all clones with less than 5 copies from ``df``:


    .. code-block:: python

        >>> df.copies.min()
        1
        >>> df = filter_by_overall_copies(df, 5)
        >>> df.copies.min()
        4

def filter_functional(df, functional=True):
    '''
    Removes clones on functionality, by default removing non-functional clones.
    Setting ``functionality`` to ``False`` removes functional clones.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        The DataFrame to filter.
    functional : bool
        The functionality of the clones to include.  Set to ``True`` (the
        default) to include functional clones only.  Set to ``False`` to only
        include non-functional clones.

    DataFrame filtered by functionality.

    ``gene`` usage less than or equal to ``min_frequency``.

    For example, if ``min_frequency=0.05`` and ``by='subject'``, all clones
    using a V-gene with a frequency less than or equal to 0.05 in a given
    subject are removed.

    df : pd.DataFrame
        The DataFrame to filter.
    min_frequency : float
        The minimum frequency of a gene in ``by`` that should be included.
    by : str
        The column on which to calculate frequency.  Defaults to ``subject``.
    gene : str
        The gene on which to filter.  Accepts ``v_gene`` or ``j_gene``

    func : function
        The comparison function to use between `n` and the number of

    limit_to : list(str), str, None
        If specified, overlap will be limited to the specified pools.  This is
