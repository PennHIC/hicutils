``hicutils``: HIC utilities for AIRR-seq data
=============================================

The ``hicutils`` package is a suite of tools for loading, filtering,
manipulating, and plotting `AIRR-seq
<https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/>`_ data in `standard AIRR format
<https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/datarep/rearrangements.html>`_.  It
is specifically meant to interact with `ImmuneDB <http://immunedb.com>`_ and
provide utilities commonly used in the Human Immunology Core at the University
of Pennsylvania, but may be used with AIRR-seq output from other tools.
